## Where do I get YimMenu now?

YimMenu will move to binary only releases, please check the YimMenu UnknownCheats thread for more information.

[UnknownCheats YimMenu thread](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/grand-theft-auto-v/476972-yimmenu.html)

Make sure to read the post in-depth, mainly the FSL part and why it's important to make use of it. 

## Where's the source code?

Because of DMCA take down request from Take-Two Interactive wherein they mentioned 2 commits made to the GTAV-Classes repository, I've decided to take down the whole repository.
They mentioned the YimMenu repository as well as infringing though they did not give clear examples (aside from the `src/gta/` folder).

To prevent any future issue where Take-Two Interactive may persue with legal measures it's unlikely the source code of either YimMenu or GTAV-Classes will be put up again.

## Purpose of this repository

The YimMenu repository contained some information that is useful for Lua developers as well as making the chat translation features work.

As such I'll put those parts of the repository public again.

## Thanks

Thanks to every that has contributed over the years to the YimMenu project.

Sadly because some people cannot reverse engineer properly and stooped so low as to copy paste from the leaked GTA V source code, we've gotten ourselves in this predicament.
